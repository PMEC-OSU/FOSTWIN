<!-- ## Mask Basin Workshop & FOSTWIN Digital Twin omit in toc -->

Develop a controller for a digital twin of the [FOSWEC](https://energy.sandia.gov/foswec-testing-helps-validate-open-source-modeling-code/) device.
The goal of this controller will be to generate the ***most electrical power*** while running on a ***real-time digital twin***.
The competition will focus on the FOSWEC v2 device tested at the [OSU O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory](https://engineering.oregonstate.edu/facilities/wave-lab).
The top ***N*** electrical power producing controllers will be selected based off data produced and gathered during the simulation and the developer will be awarded bragging rights and travel expense reimbursement for attending the [MASK Basin](https://www.defense.gov/Multimedia/Photos/igphoto/2001207018/#:~:text=The%20Navy's%20Indoor%20Ocean%20%2D%2D,Carderock%20Division%2C%20located%20in%20Maryland.) Workshop in **September 2023**.

### Goals of Competition <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Connect motivated WEC developers with industry leaders and researchers
2. Build experience with developing **real-time** controllers to produce **electrical power** (or other useful work) in WEC devices
3. Extend on content from the [2019 PMEC Workshop](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/events/integrated-wec-design-theory-and-practice-workshop) (video below of PMEC Workshop) and learn about FOSWEC devices
4. Acquire knowledge about WEC modeling in working with the [FOSTWIN](https://github.com/PMEC-OSU/FOSTWIN) open source repository
5. Learn from Sandia WEC experts and the NAVY about developing System Identification (SID) methods from large scale testing to improve WEC modeling
6. Deepen understanding of digital twin techniques between the [WECSim](https://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/master/index.html) and [System Identification](https://github.com/PMEC-OSU/FOSTWIN#system-identification-model) digital twins available in the interface.

### Competition Award

While everyone who participates in this competition will have the opportunity to advance their WEC modeling and controller skills through the events leading to the [competition submission date](#competition-timeline), the developers of the top ***N*** controllers will be awarded travel expense reimbursement to attend the [**MASK Basin workshop**](https://www.defense.gov/Multimedia/Photos/igphoto/2001207018/#:~:text=The%20Navy's%20Indoor%20Ocean%20%2D%2D,Carderock%20Division%2C%20located%20in%20Maryland.) in **September 2023**.
Through the final workshop, and the events leading up to the competition submission date, participants and awardees will meet industry leaders and WEC experts from Sandia, Oregon State University, and the NAVY (just to name a few) to grow their wave energy network.

At the workshop, the winning developers will participate in a large scale tank testing campaign of the [Sandia WaveBot](https://www.youtube.com/embed/c4npWk_-Pjk).
In doing so, the awardees will learn in-depth details about tank testing of WEC devices to validate System Identification modeling techniques.
In addition to the measurements collected and the numerical methods used in the system identification validation, the awardees will gain hands-on experience with the tools, sensors, and methodology used to measure forces exerted on and throughout the WEC.

## Steps to Participate
In order to participate in the competition, there's just a few steps you'll need to take:

1. Enroll in the FOSTWIN control competition (*link coming soon*)
2. Get familiar with the FOSWEC Digital Twin and the associated web interface
3. Develop a custom controller as a Simulink Real-Time model & run in real-time through the web platform
4. Collect & submit your results from the real-time simulation(s)

To participate in this competition, you must have a few pre-requisites:

- Valid [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) license 
- Valid [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) license
- (Optional) Valid [Simscape](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape.html) license and [Simscape Multibody](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape-multibody.html) license - **Only required if wanting to work with the WECSim twin in local development**


### Getting Familiar <!-- omit in toc -->

To aid both the WEC development community and new users interested in learning about real-time control of digital twins through the web interface, we've created an [open source repository](https://github.com/PMEC-OSU/FOSTWIN).
This repo contains all code and instructions needed to run the twin and a provided default controller locally, develop your custom controller locally, then upload it to the web interface and have it execute in real-time on our remote Speedgoat and host machine set up!
Through this repository, you can get familiar with the two digital twin types we've developed of the FOSWEC device, as well as take a provided default controller applying a velocity proportional damping system and see what changes you can make to maximize the power output.

Other than the open source repository, we also plan to host a variety of public workshops to provide information about real-time dynamics modeling, developing controllers for real-time simulations, and point out the challenges and benefits of using real-time controllers with digital twins.

### Developing a Custom Controller and Run Through Web Interface <!-- omit in toc -->

Through the [open source repository](https://github.com/PMEC-OSU/FOSTWIN), we've provided an example controller that users can take as a starting point.
Then, through the non-real-time modes, you can enable when running the open source code locally, you can iteratively make changes until you're satisfied with your simulation results.

| *Default Controller, note the inports on the left for real-time control coming from the web interface!* |

From there, you can begin to test the controller through the web interface in real-time mode (or on your local Speedgoat if you have one).
One unique benefit of real-time simulations is the ability to change parameters or values while the model is running.  Via the web platform you can experiment, in real-time while a simulation is running, with different values for parameters like the damping force applied to one of the torque shafts of the FOSTWIN (FOSWEC Digital Twin).
Through these real-time experiments, you can learn what ranges of values for parameters in your controller cause model instability or find the sweet spot for parameters that maximize the power output of the system.
While working with the web interface, you'll get charts of the data flowing throughout the system and are able to download your simulation results to further your experimentation with post-processing in MATLAB.
